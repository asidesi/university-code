year 2 and 3 Engineering code
For this code it is important to understand that this was the first attempt of me using the finite differencing method to solve a 2-D differential equation.
Even so the overall outcome of this project was to display the heat dissipation on a 2-D plate which was fully achieved in MATLAB.
Moreover, if one were to replicate this code it would be important to understand what boundary conditions are being used in the discretized grid.
